                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to Otik. Otik is a music app that was built as part of my Software Engineering Boot Camp at General Assembly. 
                    It was born out of my love for music and my desire to create a platform for my friends to host their work. 
                    It was made utilizing Mongoose, MongoDb, Express, React, and AWS.

                <p>
                    As the database gets filled out with new musicians and music, I will continue to build in new features and content.
                    If you have ideas for the app or any concerns, please reach out connorabyram@gmail.com.
